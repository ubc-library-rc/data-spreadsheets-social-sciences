Good data organization is the foundation of your research
project. Most researchers have data or do data entry in
spreadsheets. Spreadsheet programs are very useful graphical
interfaces for designing data tables and handling very basic data
quality control functions.

### Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Implement best practices in data table formatting to support your research
2. Identify and address common formatting mistakes
3. Understand approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets
4. Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
5. Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs

### Spreadsheet programs

Many spreadsheet programs are available. We will use Microsoft Excel in our examples.
Although it is not open source software it is very widely available and used. Free spreadsheet programs such as LibreOffice are available.
The functionality of these may differ from Excel, but in general they can be used to perform similar tasks.
