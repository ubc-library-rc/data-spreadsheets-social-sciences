## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Implement best practices in data table formatting to support your research
2. Identify and address common formatting mistakes
3. Understand approaches for handling dates in spreadsheets
4. Utilize basic quality control features and data manipulation practices
5. Effectively export data from spreadsheet programs

In this lesson, you will **not** learn about **data analysis** with spreadsheets. Much of your time as a researcher will be spent in the initial ‘data wrangling’ stage, where you need to organize the data to perform a proper analysis later. It’s not the most fun, but it is necessary. In this lesson you will learn how to think about data organization and some practices for more effective data wrangling. With this approach you can plan new data collection so less data wrangling is needed.

### What this lesson will not teach you
