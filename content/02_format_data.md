## Data formatting problems

The most common mistake made is treating spreadsheet programs like lab notebooks, that is,
relying on context, notes in the margin,
spatial layout of data and fields to convey information. As humans, we
can (usually) interpret these things, but computers don't view information the same way, and
unless we explain to the computer what every single thing means (and
that can be hard!), it will not be able to see how our data fit
together.

Using the power of computers, we can manage and analyze data in much more
effective and faster ways, but to use that power, we have to set up
our data for the computer to be able to understand it (and computers are very
literal).

This is why itâ€™s extremely important to set up well-formatted
tables from the outset - before you even start entering data from
your very first preliminary experiment. Data organization is the
foundation of your research project. It can make it easier or harder
to work with your data throughout your analysis, so it's worth
thinking about when you're doing your data entry or setting up your
experiment. You can set things up in different ways in spreadsheets,
but some of these choices can limit your ability to work with the data in other programs or
have the you-of-6-months-from-now or your collaborator work with the
data.
