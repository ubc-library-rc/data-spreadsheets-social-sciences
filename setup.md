### Software
>
> To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, 
> Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, 
> Onlyoffice, WPS office
> or other programs. Commands may differ a bit between programs, but
> the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.
>
> **For this lesson, we will mainly use Microsoft Excel.** If you do not
> have access to Microsoft Excel, you can also use LibreOffice, which is 
> a free, open source spreadsheet program. Many functions will be similar 
> to Excel. 
>
> macOS users who use Apple's Numbers application should note that it does not
> contain some of the features (particularly data validation) that we will
> be using. Please use LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel instead.
